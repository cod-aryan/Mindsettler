**MindSettler** is a professional-grade mental health platform built to democratize access to specialized therapy. Designed by an AI student at **NIT Surat**, this project addresses the logistical friction in mental healthcare through an automated booking engine, a secure internal economy (Wallet), and smart-activation digital session rooms.

## 🎯 The "Problem vs. Solution" Philosophy

### 1. The Friction Problem
**Problem:** Traditional healthcare platforms have high drop-off rates due to "Transaction Anxiety" at the point of booking.  
**Solution:** The **MindSettler Wallet**. By pre-loading credits, users can book a session with a single click. This also enables instant, frictionless refunds if a session is rescheduled or rejected by the administrator.

### 2. The Ghost Link Problem
**Problem:** Users often struggle with when to join a session, leading to missed appointments.  
**Solution:** **Smart-Room Logic**. Meeting links are hidden and "Room Locked" until exactly **10 minutes before** the session (IST), providing a clear, stress-free countdown.

### 3. The Security Gap
**Problem:** Public APIs are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and spam.  
**Solution:** **Tiered Rate Limiting**. Stricter limits are applied to Auth and Corporate inquiry routes to prevent bot abuse using `express-rate-limit`.

## ✨ Core Features

### 💰 Secure Virtual Wallet System
* **Atomic Transactions:** Backend ensures the wallet balance is debited simultaneously with the appointment creation using Mongoose sessions to prevent partial data states.
* **Instant Reversals:** If an admin cancels or rejects a session, funds are returned to the user's wallet instantly via automated transaction logic.

### 📅 Intelligent Therapy Scheduler
* **Time-Aware Filtering:** Automatically hides past time slots for the current day to prevent impossible bookings.
* **Specialized Modalities:** Choose from CBT, DBT, ACT, Schema Therapy, and more.

### 🎥 Hybrid Session Ecosystem
* **Digital & Physical:** Support for both **Online (Video)** and **Offline (In-Clinic)** sessions.
* **Flexible Payments:** Dual-mode checkout allowing users to pay via **Virtual Wallet** for instant digital booking or **Cash-on-Arrival** for physical clinic visits.

### 📧 Automated Email Notifications
* **Booking Confirmation:** Instant professional HTML email sent upon successful booking with session details and Google Calendar integration.
* **Status Alerts:** Real-time notifications sent via Nodemailer for session **Approvals** or **Rejections**.
* **Smart Refund Alerts:** If a session is rejected, the user receives an email confirming the automatic wallet credit reversal.

### 📖 Clinical Continuity Tools
* **Post-Session Insights:** Admins provide revision notes and homework, which appear in the user's "Concluded Sessions" view.
* **Private Reflection Journal:** A dedicated space for users to record personal breakthroughs, separate from therapist notes.

## 🛠️ Technical Problem Solving

* **Vercel Cookie Persistence:** Solved the "Cookie not saving" issue on serverless functions by setting `app.set("trust proxy", 1)` and configuring JWT cookies with `SameSite: "None"` and `Secure: true`.
* **Async Email Dispatch:** Integrated professional HTML templates with `Nodemailer` to handle concurrent user notifications without blocking the main event loop.
* **Rate Limiting on Edge:** Implemented `express-rate-limit` with `trust proxy` enabled to accurately track user IPs across Vercel’s serverless infrastructure.
* **Google Calendar IST Fix:** Developed a custom helper to generate GCal links that force the `Asia/Kolkata` timezone, preventing 5.5-hour shifts caused by UTC conversion.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Data Modeling

* **Mongoose Referencing:** Utilizes `DocumentReferences` for relational integrity between `Appointments` and `Users`.
* **Lifecycle Hooks:** Backend triggers automated email controllers specifically during the `.save()` or `.findByIdAndUpdate()` lifecycle of an appointment.
* **Complex Aggregations:** Uses MongoDB pipelines to filter available therapist slots based on real-time booking status and user-specific timezone offsets.

## 🔐 Security & Optimization
* **JWT in HttpOnly Cookies:** Prevents XSS attacks by ensuring tokens are inaccessible via client-side JavaScript.
* **Helmet.js Integration:** Implements standard security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) to harden the Express server.
* **CORS Policy:** Strict whitelist-based CORS configuration to ensure only the MindSettler frontend can communicate with the API.
